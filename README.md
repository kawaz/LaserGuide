# CursorFinder

A macOS app that displays laser-like lines from screen corners to your mouse cursor, making it easier to locate your cursor on large or multiple displays.

## Features

- **Laser Lines**: Displays gradient laser lines from all four screen corners to your mouse cursor
- **Multi-Display Support**: Works seamlessly across multiple monitors
- **Smart Visibility**: Automatically hides when the mouse is idle and reappears on movement
- **Screenshot Safe**: Laser lines are excluded from screenshots (macOS's built-in screenshot tools won't capture them)
- **Distance Indicator**: Shows percentage distance when cursor is on another screen
- **Visual Effects**: 
  - Tapered laser lines (thick at corners, thin near cursor)
  - Gradient coloring for better visibility
  - GPU-optimized rendering using Metal

## Requirements

- macOS 15.3 or later
- Xcode 15.0 or later (for building from source)
